    <h5>
        <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).

        Front End and Back End
    </h2>
    <h4>
        <b>Front End Development</b>
    </h4>
    <h5>
        The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. <br>
        It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and navigation menu. <br>
        <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> are the languages used for Front End development. <br>
        The structure, design, behavior, and content of everything seen on browser screens when websites, web applications, or mobile apps are opened up, is implemented by front End developers. 
        Responsiveness and performance are two main objectives of the Front End. <br>
        
        <b>Front End languages: </b>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="E:\Web Development\Notes\HTML\HTML basics.html"><b>HTML:</b></a> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to design the front-end portion of web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text documentation within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.</li>
            <li><b>CSS:</b> Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language used to make web pages presentable. CSS allows Web Developer to apply styles to web pages.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b> JavaScript is a scripting language used to make the site interactive for the user. It is used to enhancing the functionality of a website to running cool games and web-based software.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b>Front End Frameworks: </b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>AngularJS</b></li>
            <li><b>React.JS</b></li>
            <li><b>jQuery</b></li>
            <li><b>SASS</b></li>
            <li>many more</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        To summarize Front End Development, HTML is used to form the structure of the Website, CSS is used to style the Website and JS is used to add behaviour/functionality to the Website. <br><br>
    </h5>
    <h4>
        <b>BackEnd Development</b>
    </h4>    
    <h5>
        Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. <br>
        It is the part of the website that user cannot see and interact with. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. <br>
        Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend. <br>
        
        <b>Front End languages: </b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>PHP:</b>PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.</li>
            <li><b>C++:</b>It is a general-purpose programming language</li>
            <li><b>Python:</b>It is a general-purpose programming language. It comes with powerful libraries for almost everything, especially Data Science and Web Development.</li>
            <li><b>Node.js:</b>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. Note that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a programming language.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>BackEnd Frameworks: </b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Express</b></li>
            <li><b>Django</b></li>
            <li><b>Rails</b></li>
            <li><b>Laravel</b></li>
            <li>many more</li>
        </ul>
